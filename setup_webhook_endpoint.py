BlockBee Payment Webhook Handler

According to BlockBee documentation, payments are notified via webhooks to the callback URL.
We need to set up an endpoint to receive these notifications.

print("‚úÖ How BlockBee Works:")
print("1. You create a payment address with a callback URL")
print("2. When payment is received, BlockBee sends a webhook to your callback URL")
print("3. The webhook contains transaction details (txid, amount, confirmations)")
print("4. You process the webhook to update order status")

print("üîß Required Solution:")
print("1. Set up a webhook endpoint at the callback URL")
print("2. Process incoming webhooks from BlockBee")

print("4. Notify user via Telegram bot")

print("üí° Alternative for Testing:")
print("Since we can't receive webhooks locally, we need to:")
print("1. Use BlockBee's test mode or sandbox")
print("2. Manually simulate payment confirmation")
print("3. Or use a service like ngrok to expose local webhook endpoint")
