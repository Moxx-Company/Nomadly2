üîç DUPLICATE PAYMENT ANALYSIS
============================

ISSUE DETECTED: User clicking ETH payment button multiple times

EVIDENCE:
- Payment Address 1: 0x421A34BA9bd27e25F50Fb0470D924Ed56D0084d9 (Order: 038e8d73-2b45-4e4a-8183-3b206d19b734)
- Payment Address 2: 0x356073F4AD9154FA0eDa913a8CD9Bf71f948Dc78 (Order: 2e629520-611e-4ef9-ae2b-d83b018c0558)

ROOT CAUSE:
- No button state management to prevent rapid clicks
- User may click button while previous payment is processing
- No visual feedback indicating payment creation in progress

IMPACT:
- Multiple payment addresses for same domain
- Potential user confusion about which address to use
- Unnecessary BlockBee API calls

SOLUTION NEEDED:
1. Add button state management (disable after click)
2. Show loading state during payment creation
3. Check for existing payment before creating new one

CURRENT STATUS: Active monitoring - user completed payment flow successfully
